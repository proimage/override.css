override.css
============

An override stylesheet for ExpressionEngine 2 that addresses niggling Control Panel issues that can be fixed purely by CSS.

What it does:
-------------
  - Adds dropdown arrow indicators to the main navigation items that have submenus
  - Adds subtle mouseover effects to submit buttons

Usage
-----
To use, place `override.css` in your `/themes/cp_themes/default/css/` directory (or in the `css/` directory for whichever theme you're using), and refresh the CP. If you already have an `override.css` in there, you can of course just add the contents of this `override.css` into the existing one.

Overriding the Control Panel styles is [officially documented by EllisLab] (http://ellislab.com/expressionengine/user-guide/development/cp_styles/#overriding-control-panel-style).
